# How to install

Installing DoctorModeration is very easy !

First, `git clone https://github.com/loockeeer/doctor_moderation`
Then, create a file in `src` called `token.json` with your token in a string inside (`"TOKEN"`)

You'll need to install PostgreSQL and then to pipe `database.sql` into it.
